RoomSolver aims to simplify the process of finding rental or sale properties by offering a user-friendly interface and advanced features. Users can create, update, and search property listings, and receive personalized recommendations based on their preferences. The platform ensures secure authentication through Google OAuth and efficient media management using Firebase Storage. An AI chatbot is integrated to assist users with their queries and enhance the overall user experience.

## Features

### 1. Google OAuth Authentication
RoomSolver uses Google OAuth for secure and straightforward user authentication. This allows users to log in using their Google accounts, ensuring a fast and secure sign-in process.

### 2. Firebase Storage
RoomSolver utilizes Firebase Storage to store and manage user-generated content such as property images. Firebase provides scalable and secure storage solutions, ensuring that all media assets are handled efficiently.

### 3. Create and Update Listings
Users can create and update property listings easily. This feature allows users to:
- Add new property listings with detailed information and images.
- Edit existing listings to update information or images.

### 4. Search Functionality
RoomSolver offers advanced search capabilities, enabling users to:
- Search for properties based on various criteria such as location, price, and type (rent or sale).
- Get personalized recommendations to match their specific needs.

### 5. AI Chatbot for Customer Support
RoomSolver includes an AI chatbot that provides real-time assistance to users. This chatbot helps:
- Answer common queries.
- Guide users through the process of finding and booking properties.
- Provide support and information about the platform.

### 6. JSON Web Token (JWT) and Cookies
RoomSolver uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication and session management. JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between two parties. The key benefits of using JWT are:
- Securely transmitting information between the client and server.
- Verifying the token's integrity and authenticity.

Cookies are used to store the JWT on the client side, ensuring that users remain authenticated across different sessions and page reloads.
